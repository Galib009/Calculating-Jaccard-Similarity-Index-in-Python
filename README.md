# Calculating Jaccard Similarity Index in Jupyter Notebook (Python)

The Jaccard similarity index compares members for two sets to see which members are shared and which are distinct. Itâ€™s a measure of similarity for the two sets of data, with a range from 0 to 1. The closer to 1, the more similar the two sets of data.


I calculated the Pangenome from whole genome sequences (WGS) of _E. coli_ using the tool, [Roary](sanger-pathogens.github.io/Roary/) . I have generated the Jaccard similarity index To identify similarities between pangenome and antibiotic sensitivity data using a user-defined function.
